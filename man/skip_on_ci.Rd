\usage{
skip_on_ci()

exit_on_ci()
}
\value{
If called within a \CRANpkg{tinytest} test running on CI, triggers
an exit condition; otherwise, either a string saying \dQuote{\code{On CI}}
or \code{NULL} invisibly

\section{\dQuote{Skip} vs \dQuote{Exit}}{

\pkg{tinyexpect} provides both \dQuote{\code{skip_}} and \dQuote{\code{exit_}}
versions of \dQuote{stop testing} functions due to the different philosophies
of \CRANpkg{tinytest} and \CRANpkg{testthat}; in \CRANpkg{testthat}, tests
are encapsulated by \code{\link[testthat]{test_that}()} to create smaller
testing units within a single test file. As such, if a series of tests need
to be passed over for some reason, it makes sense to \dQuote{skip} a
\code{\link[testthat]{test_that}()} block and move on to the next block

\CRANpkg{tinytest}, however, treats each test file as a testing unit. Each
file in \code{inst/tinytest} is equivalent to a \CRANpkg{testthat}
\code{\link[testthat]{test_that}()} block; as such, if a series of tests need
to be passed over for some reason, it makes sense to \dQuote{exit} a test
file and mnove on to the next file in \code{inst/tinytest}

In order to provide compatibility with users transitioning from
\CRANpkg{testthat} to \CRANpkg{tinytest}, and to provide continuity with the
\CRANpkg{tinytest} philosophy, \pkg{tinyexpect} provides both \code{skip_}-
and \code{exit_}- prefixed \dQuote{stop testing} functions that work
identically to one another
