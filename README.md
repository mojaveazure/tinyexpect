# tinyexpect v0.0.0.9010

### Additional Expecation Predicates for the ‘tinytest’ Testing Framework

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ports of ‘testthat’ expectation predicates to the ‘tinytest’ testing
framework. These ports allow easier transitioning from ‘testthat’ to
‘tinytest’ as well as provide more explicit expectation predicates for
‘tinytest’ users.

## Installation

tinyexpect is available on R-universe, and can be installed with:

``` r
install.packages("tinyexpect", repos = c("https://mojaveazure.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))
```
